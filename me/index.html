You know, for ages I kinda thought I was the kid troubled,
the misfit the stupid the one that just didn't get it.

Then I took the liberty of expanding my mind,
to get to know of similar kind,
to make me to promise me open up my eyes,
to gimme a way to realize

that the path here may be less traveled,
the trinkets, odd clocks far less acquired,

but a people there, a people here
we agreed to meet up where

we'd care up on our kins,
party with filled up ale skins
and promise to never stop
to go forth and learn a lot 
of how to care of our kin kind
and do of things grand and fine

to build upon the things ever great
a thing or two of great strength
to carry on the words a far
about love, about caring heart.

There is a chance that I love you, greater that I would not.
