<h3>So there was this conference here</h3>
<p class="meta">27 Apr 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Yes, yes, we did have a <a href="http://www.agilejkl.com">small conference here</a>, in my home town. I was, with many other people, participating on the proceedings of the event.</p>

<p>It went fine, there was much of magnificent stuff and I can never be too grateful for all people who participated in making the event so good as it was. I&#39;m in especial gratitude to the people who didn&#39;t come, since you&#39;re pretty much the reason why similar event should be arranged next year too, so that you could be enlightened, happy, have a few laughs and meet people.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m not really sure if that&#39;s enough.</p>

<h2>And that&#39;s just my opinion</h2>

<p>And it&#39;s not really up to me. It&#39;s actually very much up to you, since anyone can do this stuff, and it&#39;s not all that hard. Takes time and effort though, both of which I did not sacrifice much this year, compared to other guys.
 But well, I&#39;m somewhat apt at feeling grumpy anyway.</p>

<p>You see, this stuff, it ain&#39;t made for you. I mean, of course it is, but not for you as an individual.</p>

<p>Years back, we decided to drive towards certain goal, which was to make things improve around Central Finland. Mostly concerning our industry, since we&#39;re all, well, in doings with software development.</p>

<p>Event has had a local ring to it. This year, we had one local speaker (and I know there would be bunch of really good ones in addition) performing in each track.</p>

<p>We were extremely happy that many locally (meaning mostly Jyv채skyl채 area) operating companies took part in sponsoring. Also, <a href="http://www.ketky.fi/">KETKY</a> approached us, which is splendid. Extraordinary even.</p>

<h2>And the point is?</h2>

<p>Well. We could use some help. We could have used some help. Not with the conference things in particular, that we managed quite alright in our own homebrewish manner.</p>

<p>But the most feedback I get, is that &quot;if I&#39;d known the conference was about <strong>management/leadership/marshmallows</strong>, I&#39;d have told person xyz about that&quot;.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter all that much what names you put to posters really, it doesn&#39;t matter what you put to your website, much of the stuff goes by word of mouth.</p>

<p>Now when we really aim to improve understanding of management and leadership practices in order of achieving better working conditions in whole Central Finland area, it&#39;s a bit of a kick to groin.</p>

<p><strong>We&#39;d benefit much of help from local media, mainly the local newspaper, for example.</strong></p>

<p>This is something, where I am at my wits end. We tried to be loud. We tried to make ourself known to sources who would have had the option on telling about the happening for virtually everyone who should have been there.</p>

<p>And believe me, it&#39;s not for me. It&#39;s not for us. It would have been for the city we care about so much, that we spend numerous hours on creating an event where people could just come. And listen, and talk and take shitload of stuff among with them to local workplaces and start improving.</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy that we attracted many of the people outside the Finnish agile mafia this year. It could still have been better, but well, we did all we could. We are not international. We are not &quot;big&quot; (though about 250 participants sorta is). We do not aim to promote anything. We aim to build up and improve local work, that is plenty enough. I&#39;m sort of amazed, that the local bullhorns, responsible for much of information sharing around the area, <strong>don&#39;t react</strong>.  </p>

<p>I feel sorta bad for Jyv채skyl채. A bit of a failure. There&#39;s not much that can save our debt ridden struggling city, but good starts and shitload of improving on IT sector, on ICT sector if you will.</p>

<h2>Will it...</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been asked plenty of times &quot;How about next year? What will there be?&quot;. Well, if it&#39;s up to me, <strong>nothing</strong>. It&#39;s up to <strong>YOU</strong> :) We have pretty good contacts around and things sorted out. If you want to hop along, throw an email to agilejkl@agilejkl.com for example. Come to chat on upcoming Agile Dinners, which will be fabulous, by the way! Holler us up on Twitter, on streets. Talk to your co-workers. Come to IRC (ircnet/#agilejkl). Think and talk. You are awesome.</p>
