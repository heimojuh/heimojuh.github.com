# Shut the fuck up about agile already!

**Manifesto** is everything. Manifesto is a thing that has affected countless of software industry professionals. 
And me.

One thing what manifesto rather clearly dictates, is that making software is a people sport. The emphasis is on communication,
and what is somewhat surprising now to think of standard agile discussion in year 2013: exploring a new. Uncovering is the word.
We want ourselves to *uncover* ways to do shit better. We want ourselves to think what we do, and work towards betterment.

Yet we seem to be a bit stuck. Yea, we may argue about stuff that has already imprinted themselves to software development
as "must know" practises, like storypoints and whatnot. In places where such practises are valued, this is terribly important. As
well as it's important to know that such places exist (and they're plenty). Still, what makes the difference is that most interesting
discussions concerning software development are the ones where *agile is not mentioned*.

## It is people sport

It's not all that long a go that I was listening to [Jim Coplien speak about Scrum](http://vimeo.com/42772592). I believe word agile was mentioned too, but never the less, he is an interesting person.

When he says, that he can double the velocity (we now assume that velocity is good thing and worth measuring) of your team per iteration, I wouldn't doubt it.

He is Jim Coplien. He can do it. And he can to many more astounding things to make you do your shit better. And I do believe the ultimate goal is to make sure that you do strut your stuff better and better.

He can do it. Since it is a people sport.

Interestingly, that has very little to do with the institutionalized agile, which is served to you via certifications and few named methodologies.

If you want to pay for value, pay for people. Pay for hearing people speak. Don't pay for arbitrary courses standardized by your organization. Because: *it is a people sport*. Mechanics cannot relate to your situation, but people can and will.

## What the fuck am I doing

This got a bit out of hand, so I'm splitting stuff to several parts. Next one up is called **Name on the box**, and will focus on institutionalization of certain aspects, which by definition should not be so.
