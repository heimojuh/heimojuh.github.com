From time to time I encounter this question. Time to think a little about it really.
This is not just my opinion, it is the universal truth.

So, is it okay to be "just a programmer". It depends, I'd say:

**Yes**, if you feel delight when you can help a colleague with a problem. You want to encourage peers to think, generally want to discuss on making things better.

**No**, if you think this is everyone for her/himself kind of business. You secretly smirk and take joy of other people's problems.

**Yes**, if you think that people who are enthusiastically into Agile, Lean of some other word are full of shit and suck donkey balls. Heck, even I might think so sometimes. But still you listen, understand that even if most of it is fad, there's something that's worth hearing out. You comment with insight, not with repulsion or violence.

**No**, if you think that Agile, Lean enthusiast are incompetent, walking bags of donkey shit who should all die.

**Yes**, if your programming is dictated by customer demand and your goal is for them to be satisfied. You could be lean start-up sort of being, or anything.

**No**, if you not only think that things people are asking for are worth shit, but the people too.

**Yes**, if you want to know why you program. How you program. What are the reasons you currently program and what benefit it gives.

**No**, if you'd actually want to do something else than be a programmer.

**Yes**, if you want to continuously improve your programming.

**No**, if you think programming is something others tell you to do.

**Yes**, if you care about the way you do so, that you want to know why work items are in the list

**No**, if you just want someone to give you the mentioned item, do it in five minutes and watch kittens from internet for rest of the day.

**No**, if you'd like to use Jira on your spare time projects.

**No**, if you think everything new, languages, tools, methods, sounds, tastes, colors are just there to bug you.

**No**, if you like to be bugged by everything new and also like to complain about that.

**No**, if you think it's your employers duty to teach you EVERYTHING.

**No**, if you are a hamster, since that'd be scary as shit.

**Yes**, if you are a programming motherfucker, armed with yearning to solve all problems with the power that is given.

**No**, if you are a programming dickhead.

Generally, being "just a programmer" is mighty fine. Programming is something that makes us powerful, it also gives us responsibility. If just programming means making trouble, slowing things intentionally down it also means costs. Costs for others, and costs for you. But it is the others that pay.

I am just a programmer. That is the shit.
