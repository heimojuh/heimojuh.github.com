I gotta say that I'm fooling you a little. I do think that we have had enough manifestos for a while.  I also like to tease things up a little. Thus I think that "Communist manifesto" is a decent pair of words for explaining something that aims to equalize the workforce and equalize the ownership. All in effort to create better software products and offer better service in world of I(C)T.

### WHY

Because it is all about power.

About **power** and **oppression**.

And that is all happening around us, in form of a structural manifestation we like to nurture within our organizations. We tend them, like we tend our babies. We are worried, if the metrics show that it is ill. We like to think that it is alive, and it has a direction which can be managed, steered, controlled with practices concerning it and it alone.

[We raise bodies](http://www.pmi.org/), institutions, to cement the existence of such **a thing**. We often wield it as a weapon, we wield as a source of "yes, but"s. It's bottomless what comes to makeshift rules. It is twisted. It is a base of:

### POWER

And all the games that come with it. It is something sowing the seeds for conflict between classes that should not exist in first place. It's the thing grinding onwards generating more and more friction as it goes because it makes you focus on all the wrong things.

Because there's rooted belief that the labor has limited value, accusation based on the fact on how we try to steer the outcome of labor strictly by acting on the **thing** that embodies it, we often times try to reduce that amount of labor instead of making it meaningful. Simply because when evaluating **it**, we tend not to look at the beauty, we look at the size.

This causes separation of interests. It creates a ruling class, which is responsible of **it** and the oppressed one that keeps getting pushed from the source which we like to name like "customer satisfaction" or other noble cause. The possible success is ripped from the back skin of the proletariat generating the value they are not likely to see, or be part of, ever. Simply because we believe in responsibility, and **it** is greedy on having someone tending on itself by promising golden apples, by promising the glory of taming, slaying, the beast.

Small surprise we condemn **it** to be a failure before it is even born. Small surprise the default result in our minds is for **it** to fail.Small surprise that the proletariat, with the hands hardened in beating of the stone to match the shape requested, has explored [new means](http://www.slideshare.net/aterreno/programmer-anarchy).

You should too.

Since we need

###Equality

**Project** is the factory where programmers are oppressed. The ability to make a difference are taken from the people hired because of their ability to do so. Project is the conveyor belt moving the fruits baked by bleeding hands away from their reach. Project is the beast that makes people dull, hopeless and poor in using their tool, the brain.

Thus it is time to rise, programmers, rise.

Programmers of the World, unite! You have nothing to lose
but your gantt charts, project managers and billing rate statistics.
And your cubicles.

If we can get rid of the artificial division of workforce, the
division of why and what, and get to work in a way that everyone is
responsible for great products and services, we can get the meaning
back to our work as programmers.
