<h3>Shut the fuck up about agile</h3>
<p class="meta">05 Mar 2013</p>

<div class="post">
<h1>Shut the fuck up about agile already!</h1>

<p><strong>Manifesto</strong> is everything. Manifesto is a thing that has affected countless of software industry professionals. 
And me.</p>

<p>One thing what manifesto rather clearly dictates, is that making software is a people sport. The emphasis is on communication,
and what is somewhat surprising now to think of standard agile discussion in year 2013: exploring a new. Uncovering is the word.
We want ourselves to <em>uncover</em> ways to do shit better. We want ourselves to think what we do, and work towards betterment.</p>

<p>Yet we seem to be a bit stuck. Yea, we may argue about stuff that has already imprinted themselves to software development
as &quot;must know&quot; practises, like storypoints and whatnot. In places where such practises are valued, this is terribly important. As
well as it&#39;s important to know that such places exist (and they&#39;re plenty). Still, what makes the difference is that most interesting
discussions concerning software development are the ones where <em>agile is not mentioned</em>.</p>

<h2>It is people sport</h2>

<p>It&#39;s not all that long a go that I was listening to <a href="http://vimeo.com/42772592">Jim Coplien speak about Scrum</a>. I believe word agile was mentioned too, but never the less, he is an interesting person.</p>

<p>When he says, that he can double the velocity (we now assume that velocity is good thing and worth measuring) of your team per iteration, I wouldn&#39;t doubt it.</p>

<p>He is Jim Coplien. He can do it. And he can to many more astounding things to make you do your shit better. And I do believe the ultimate goal is to make sure that you do strut your stuff better and better.</p>

<p>He can do it. Since it is a people sport.</p>

<p>Interestingly, that has very little to do with the institutionalized agile, which is served to you via certifications and few named methodologies.</p>

<p>If you want to pay for value, pay for people. Pay for hearing people speak. Don&#39;t pay for arbitrary courses standardized by your organization. Because: <em>it is a people sport</em>. Mechanics cannot relate to your situation, but people can and will.</p>

<h2>What the fuck am I doing</h2>

<p>This got a bit out of hand, so I&#39;m splitting stuff to several parts. Next one up is called <strong>Name on the box</strong>, and will focus on institutionalization of certain aspects, which by definition should not be so.</p>
