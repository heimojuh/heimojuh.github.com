<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p class="meta">18 Jan 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Yesterday I had a lovely <a href="https://twitter.com/maaretp/status/424086948181856256">discussion</a> with Maaret Pyhäjärvi on Twitter about <strong>identities</strong>. Identities, as well as titles, have that much in common that we like to label them somehow. When we label things, albeit with clear intention of making things more self explaining, we expose them for others to interpret. That makes things hard since there exists countless of factors why our interpretations tend to differ.</p>

<p>Just to make one thing clear from the start (after which I can safely side track from the subject of identities): what <a href="https://twitter.com/maaretp/status/423900407459348480">Maaret states here is absolutely right</a>. If things you provide by means you have are beneficial in your environment, and for yourself, you should stick to them. Be proud of them and utilize them for common good. Period.</p>

<p>It is plainly wrong to stand against someone&#39;s perceived identity. At least without fully understanding the reasons why such is and most likely not even then.</p>

<p>But now, why do I keep feeling uncomfortable when thinking about fitting identities together in a puzzle called team, project or what ever is the unit you&#39;re trying to grasp for?</p>

<h2>Environ</h2>

<p>In many places and occasions I repeat the following phrase:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;I don&#39;t want a career, I want to find a home.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know what that actually means, but during times it has given me some ideas. For instance, I don&#39;t believe that the home is to be found easily. Most of the time I have the feeling that I&#39;m crashing in someone else&#39;s place. Usually the chores are also divided so that people have the right identities to carry them out. If you are of type that&#39;s slightly unaware to which slot he / she would actually fit it&#39;s pretty hard to find a spot to be comfortable in. Without hiding into corner which is also a viable option. Some families extend; bring down a wall or two to make room for you, but I&#39;m not actually sure if that is something that should be expected for.</p>

<p>We are still very new at handling residents that have it in their hearts to be the mothers, fathers and janitors. Not to talk about ones who pick up the trash and want to help on expanding relations to the neighborhood. I&#39;ve heard that such actions have been seen as bad manners. I&#39;ve personally came to conclusion that when you move in, there&#39;s limited possibilities on what you can do for your habitat. Best to hope it is a fit. It can be, I&#39;m really not saying that. The chances are that if the house is missing a mother or father such figure may be very much more straightforward to acquire compared to, well, let&#39;s say a hobo. </p>

<p>Hobos are good that way that they have been in places and seen how they work while constantly submitting to new situations. <strong>Most consultancies are actually houses full of hobos.</strong> </p>

<h2>Opus</h2>

<p>I bet you now know what I&#39;m getting at. How we interpret the identities of others is largely dependant on where we have grown and what we have learned. It is not a question of <strong>if some identity is needed, harmful or good</strong>. It&#39;s about what are the needs of your household and what you are comfortable with. And what you need from others as well.</p>

<p>My identity is something in lines of a punk or street poet. What does that tell you? Probably nothing. I don&#39;t know what it means really. Has your house a need for one? Most likely it does not. </p>

<p>Most I can get out of it, is that it is an identity of brutal self exploration. Also a mandate of doing things wrong.</p>

<p>My preferred habitat would be a place where this was of no matter. Where discussions could take place regardless of perceived identity. </p>

<h2>Domus</h2>

<p>This line of thinking has left me to believe that:</p>

<p><strong>Before finding a home, one must first find a family.</strong> *</p>

<p>* or live alone but hey, &#39;ey. hey.</p>
