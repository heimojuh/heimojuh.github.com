<h3>I attack</h3>
<p class="meta">11 Jan 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I certainly don&#39;t fulfill my expectations what comes to communication in general. I abhor violence of any kind yet I constantly seem to have a hint of that in my voice. That is not the voice I want.  I seek betterment, I seek ways to improve. But while at that let me embrace it for a while. If you hear or have heard that in me it&#39;s only fair to tell you why. So there goes.</p>

<p><strong>I attack</strong> big software service corporations like Accenture, Tieto, Fujitsu, CGI, GG, all of the lot</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because many of them are about to die and it seems they&#39;re trying to take us with them. Once kings of the jungle they&#39;ll become extinct despite their attempts to hold us back with practises inherited from the industries that have nothing to do with us anymore. If ever had.
New ideas come and they&#39;re out of reach of giants prowling their lessening territory. Even if they adopt something seemingly good it&#39;s quickly turned to something to benefit only the Man, not the customer, not the worker, since they&#39;re incapable of loving truly and passionately despite of all their facade. I attack you because you lie.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I attack</strong> agile</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because it so quickly became a thing to market. It become something of so many forms that the meaning is lost. It has yielded some good practises and the core is a mindset of pure gold but there&#39;s a good chance that it will be gone. I attack, since there&#39;s so much for me to love in a thing that has helped in forging a being that is me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I attack</strong> Toyota, TPS</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because I generally don&#39;t trust the current, nor the future group of leaders to be capable of transforming the ideas from a domain to another. Yet there are  exceptions, there&#39;s gold to be found, there&#39;s fuckton of pure goodness. There&#39;s things to attack against to let other things flourish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I attack</strong> leadership</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because leadership isn&#39;t anything. It is an empty word. A word which can be given a meaning on a spot. Meaning of leadership can be anything that fits the agenda and it&#39;s a rare situation where that agenda serves the benefit of everyone involved. Granted, that can happen. At the same time though, I&#39;m pretty sure everyone believes their leadership being the <em>real thing</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I attack</strong> the Man</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since the Man don&#39;t love me, nor any of us that do the pushing. Nor does the Man love the ones we do the pushing for. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I attack</strong> JSX</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since bringing OO-paradigm to Javascript just feels so so so icky icky icky :)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I attack</strong> the business</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since in general that implies that there&#39;s business and there&#39;s something else. Yes, in business, we must be <em>brutal</em>. We must be ready to brutally show our clients that we care of them and exist to ease their needs. We must be brutally honest and brutally free from deceit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I attack</strong> male dominance in industry</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since while you don&#39;t see the problem, while I don&#39;t live with the problem day to day, it does not mean it wouldn&#39;t cause problems nor that it would not exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are some of the things I&#39;ve been seen to attack against. These, and many more I will attack against in the future.</p>

<p>Some of the things I attack against, are the things I love and will fight for.</p>
